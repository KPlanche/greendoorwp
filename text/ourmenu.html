Moving along quickly in the season: a great year for strawberries, green and yellow zucchini's have begun, the first few heads of broccoli and cauliflower are in the market, fantastic fresh lettuces of many varieties, rainbow chard and several varieties of kale. We have fresh local produce coming into our kitchen every day.

Every day we serve four kinds of sourdough bread made with organic spelt or rye flour. Our bread has no added oil or sweetener, and all loaves are vegan except the organic cheese bread.  Our soup changes daily.  It's always vegan, and always gluten free, except when it contains barley.

Our soup stock is "made from scratch" every morning, and we ensure that the soup is full of substance so that it eats like a meal in bowl.

Some of our popular soups include:

Red Lentil and Potato Soup
Tomato Soup
Leek Barley Mushroom
Bean and Vegetable
Mulligatawny
Miso Soup
Borscht
Broccoli Soup
Green Lentil Soup
Cabbage Dill Soup

Carrot Soup

Over the years, The Green Door has accumulated many hundreds of hot food recipes, and they change according to what vegetables are in season. There are many options on the steam table, and among daily variations you can expect our most popular dishes:

Currently, local ASPARAGUS is on the menu every day.  Anna makes a superb salad with organic spelt spiral pasta, cherry tomatoes, and our wonderful olive oil.  In another form it is blanched and accompanied with a subtle and creamy dill-tofu sauce.  On the steam table it appears grilled, with garlic and umesu.  Now in the peak of its season, we will occasionally make our vegan Asparagus Soup.
