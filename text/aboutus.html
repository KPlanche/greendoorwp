AN INTRODUCTION TO THE GREEN DOOR RESTAURANT

Since 1988, our mission has been to create delicious and wholesome food that is as close to its natural state as possible.  We prepare everything on our own premises, using only ingredients of superb quality.  Our menus reflect a seasonal emphasis and local supply with as many organic products as we can source and grow.

We make our food fresh daily from scratch.   The workday starts at 6:00 a.m.:  baking, blanching, blending, boiling, brewing, chopping, cutting, dicing, dishing, frying, grating, heating, juicing, kneading, pressure-cooking, reducing, roasting, sprouting, stewing, steeping, steaming, simmering, scrubbing, serving, washing, wiping and zesting.  The Green Door team of more than thirty people participate in this creative process six days a week.

The workday starts at 6:00 a.m. Put water on to boil, the menu is decided, and the ovens’ flames jump to life.  Amid blending and blanching, more workers come through the back door, prep peppers, cut carrots, rinse off organic apples, halve, quarter and core.  Soon the soup pot is on the stove; vegetables are in the oven to roast; wash the rice, there is celery to dice, telephone ringing, set up tea and coffee.

We do not have a set menu.  Every morning we assess the supply of fresh produce, and create the menu based on what ingredients are in season and plentiful.  Our repertoire includes well over 1000 dishes, and we vary the menu daily.  However, you can always find popular dishes such as the broccoli tofu stir-fry, quiche, lasagna, spanakopita, and mashed potato-kale.  

Our labeling conventions are to specifically mention when an item is organic, vegan, gluten-free, or contains dairy, egg, gluten, wheat, nuts, soy, sesame.

Please note, if you are very sensitive to these or any other ingredients, we do use these items in our restaurant.  In spite of our careful efforts, cross contamination can occur.

OUR EVERYDAY KEY INGREDIENTS 

Unlike the vast majority of restaurants, we do not use any processed commercial food-service mixes that contain preservatives or fillers. All our foods are made with whole and natural ingredients, and we know exactly what goes into every single dish and recipe. Every day we happily answer detailed questions from our customers about ingredients and how the food is made.

OILS and FATS 
We use:
·      Organic extra virgin cold pressed olive oil in all our cooking, salads and baked goods. The oil is shipped from the island of Crete in Greece directly to the Green Door. This same oil is available for sale at the restaurant, and also at our sister store, The Green Door Grocer.
·      Organic cold pressed canola oil in our baked goods (Western Canada). 
·      Pure sesame oil from Japan in some salads.
·      Natural butter and organic coconut milk in our kitchen and bakery. 

SEASONINGS 
Our major seasonings are:
·      Le Paludier Sea Salt (from the salt marshes of Guérande in France).
·      Organic San-J Gold Label Wheat-free Tamari: Tamari is naturally brewed, with a slow aging process, from whole soybeans, salt and the microorganism Aspergillus oryzae. Traditional shoyu is commonly 50% wheat, and therefore slightly sharper in flavour. Modern inexpensive 'chemical soy sauce' is not brewed, but made from hydrolized soy protein and caramel colouring; it is completely unlike brewed tamari or shoyu. 

·      Umesu:  the liquid by-product of the Japanese umeboshi plum. The 'ume' are packed in barrels with salt; the juice which is then drawn off is 'umesu'. It is salty and sour. 'Umesu' is often translated as 'ume vinegar' or 'umeboshi vinegar', although it is not a true vinegar, but a brine.
·      La Maison Orphée organic yellow mustard:  made in Québec City from Canadian mustard seed. It contains apple cider vinegar. We use it in a few dishes, including Caesar salad dressing, our baked marinated tofu salad and some hot dishes. 
·      Organic balsamic vinegar in some salad recipes.
·      Brown rice vinegar:  made from whole brown rice and spring water, naturally fermented and aged through the changing seasons.
·      Mirin:  an exquisite and authentic Japanese seasoning. Ours is tradionally made from sweet rice and rice koji (natural rice culture), naturally aged over nine months. We use Brown Rice Vinegar and Mirin in a selection of our salads: Japanese noodle, spicy Thai noodle, lemon-ginger noodle, roasted yam, and squash salads. 

SOY PRODUCTS 
·      La Soyarie Organic Tofu (ingredients: organic soybeans, water, and magnesium chloride) (Québec)
·      Noble Bean Tempeh (ingredients: soybeans, deep well water and rhizopus culture) (Ontario)
·      San J Gold Label Tamari (see SEASONINGS) 
·      NATURA Soymilk in a few desserts (e.g. rice pudding). It is vegan and contains no grain products. 

THICKENING AGENTS
·      Arrowroot flour:  an easily digested starch from the root of the arrowroot plant. We use it to thicken the broccoli tofu stir-fry sauce, stews and some desserts.  This is an alternative to corn starch or tapioca flour. 
·      Agar agar:  a gelatinous substance derived from seaweed also used in our bakery. 

ORGANIC FLOUR, PASTA AND GRAIN PRODUCTS 
·      Flours locally milled by Mountain Path (in South Mountain, Ontario). See section on BREADS.

ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS 
It is important for us to minimize waste. Our vegetables are cut and washed with care and efficiency, keeping in mind the efforts of the farmer and the rain. We buy in bulk. Containers are reused. We cook and bake from scratch, not utilizing processed food. For example, we do not use canned pumpkin, but fresh organic pumpkins from a local farmer, which we bake, purée, then make into pies. We use natural cleaning products:  Druide biodegradable laundry and dish soap, borax, washing soda, white vinegar.
